# OVERVIEW

In today's fast-paced financial world, banks and lenders face mounting pressure to make quick and accurate decisions about loan applications. The old-school method of manually evaluating loans, which relies heavily on human judgment and subjective criteria, tends to be slow, prone to mistakes, and inconsistent. To tackle these issues, many financial institutions are now embracing data-driven strategies, particularly machine learning, to streamline and improve the loan approval process.

The Bank Loan Approval Classification Project is designed to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on a set of features related to the applicant's financial history, personal information, and other relevant criteria. The objective is to build a classification model that can assist bank decision-makers by providing quick, objective, and accurate recommendations for loan approval.
