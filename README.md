# OVERVIEW

In today's fast-paced financial world, banks and lenders face mounting pressure to make quick and accurate decisions about loan applications. The old-school method of manually evaluating loans, which relies heavily on human judgment and subjective criteria, tends to be slow, prone to mistakes, and inconsistent. To tackle these issues, many financial institutions are now embracing data-driven strategies, particularly machine learning, to streamline and improve the loan approval process.

The Bank Loan Approval Classification Project is designed to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on a set of features related to the applicant's financial history, personal information, and other relevant criteria. The objective is to build a classification model that can assist bank decision-makers by providing quick, objective, and accurate recommendations for loan approval.


# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

## Stakeholders

1. Banks/ lending institution

2. Risk management department

3. Loan Officers/ Underwriting Team

4. Customers/ Loan Applicants

5. External Regulators (government agencies)

## Business Problem

1. What is the main challenge of this project?---How can we create a predictive model to classify loan applications as either approved or denied?

2. What key factors should the model take into account when deciding on loan approvals?---How can we include various factors such as income, credit score, loan amount, and employment status into the model to mirror the bankâ€™s decision-making process?

3. What data do we have available for training the model?---What features of the loan applicants (e.g., age, education level, credit history) are present in the dataset, and how do they correlate with loan approval status (approved or denied)?

4. How can machine learning techniques be applied to address this issue?---How can we utilize machine learning methods to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a new loan application will be approved or denied?

5. What is the main objective of this project?---How can we automate the loan approval decision-making process by developing a predictive model, and what level of accuracy is necessary for practical implementation?


# DATA UNDERSTANDING

## Data Source

The Dataset we are using is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/. The Bank loan approval dataset contains information about the loan Applicants that will be used to determine if they get approved for a new loan or not.

we are going to use this dataset to;

1. Develop predictive models to classify loan applications as approved or denied.

2. Analyze key factors that influence loan approval decisions.

3. Improve the efficiency and accuracy of loan approval processes through data-driven insights.

4. We are going to use python pandas,numpy and other python libraries to explore and understand the data more.
